# C# and JavaScript Basics Repository

This repository is dedicated to my personal growth as I learn the fundamentals of C# and JavaScript. It contains simple examples and exercises that help me practice core programming concepts in both languages.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment, and join me on this learning journey. Any feedback or contributions are welcome!

Happy coding!
